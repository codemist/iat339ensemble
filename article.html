                    <!--Copy from https://labs.com/how-good-office-design-can-improve-productivity/-->
                    <p> Once upon a time, offices featured cubicles or partitioned workspaces that hindered
                        communication, and enforced the idea that workers were merely cogs in a machine. It’s rare that
                        you see cubicles in corporate offices nowadays; they’re considered soulless and impersonal.
                        Open-offices have become the norm for many – and there are plenty of good reasons for this.
                        <br><br>
                        Barriers between managers and their subordinates are dismantled in an open-plan office
                        environment, making individuals feel like they’re part of a team. This set up encourages
                        collaboration and builds relationships between a workforce. Open-plan offices are also easier
                        for businesses to set up; they maximise on space and reduce running costs too.
                        <br><br>
                        But whilst there are lots of benefits to working in an open-plan office, there can be more
                        distractions in a communal setting. According to architectural design firm Gensler, ‘workplace
                        strategies that sacrifice individual focus in pursuit of collaboration will result in decreased
                        effectiveness for both.’ A frustrated employer who’s unable to focus on their individual tasks
                        won’t succeed at working collaboratively either.

                        <br><br>
                        Today we are going to be taking a close look at one of the most iconic office chairs of the past
                        three decades, the Vogue Chair by Ensemble. I have seen the chair at trade shows and had the
                        chance
                        to sit in it for very short stints at a time. Recently, we brought in a bunch of different
                        ergonomic
                        chairs to make our list of the best office chairs for 2021. One of those was the Vogue Chair.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
                    The Vogue Chair has been a bit of a polarizing chair in the office furniture world. Some of its
                    supporters swear by it and will defend its comfort and design until the bitter end. Others haven’t
                    held back in sharing their disdain for the chair. We wanted to find out for ourselves how the chair
                    performs and how comfortable it really is.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Bringing in the chair gave us the opportunity to use it for prolonged hours at a time and also gain
                    feedback from a range of people within our own office. This review will share our experience with
                    the Vogue. We will go over the reasons why the chair has become so popular and we will also cover
                    some of the potential pitfalls that may make it a bad fit for your needs.

                    adjustable arms, standard arm pads and 2.5” carpet casters. The price for an Vogue

                    changes can make a huge difference to your mindset; feel more motivated, creative and content by
                    choosing a well-designed office space.
